            "minute": "21",

    }

*published* holds the exact time the stream object has been published.  
*game-time* is the game minute when the object has been published.

* [foul](TODO): a player fouled
* [break](TODO): a team took a break
* [half-time](TODO): the current half-time has been left (half time/match end)

## Text object

        "object": {
            "message": "Hello folks, this match is amazing!"
        }
    }

            "score": {
                "home": "21",
                "guest": "22"
            },

            },
            "message": "The 21st goal of Mr. T!"
        }
    }
